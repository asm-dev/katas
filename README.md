# Code Challenges Repository

Welcome to my Code Challenges Repository ðŸ‘½

This repository serves as a **catch-all** for a wide variety of coding challenges and exercises completed mainly during my time at IronHack and KeepCoding web development bootcamps. 

Here, you'll find a diverse collection of projects ranging from basic algorithms to more complex data structures and algorithms challenges.

### Why This Repository?
---
This repository serves as a consolidated archive of my coding journey, showcasing the progression of my skills and knowledge in web development and problem-solving. 

Whether you're a fellow developer looking for inspiration or a coding enthusiast eager to tackle new challenges, I hope you find something valuable here.

### What's Inside?
---
- **IronHack Challenges:** A compilation of coding exercises and projects completed during my journey at IronHack bootcamp. These challenges helped solidify my understanding of web development concepts and technologies.
  
- **KeepCoding Exercises:** Additional coding exercises and projects completed during my time at KeepCoding bootcamp. These exercises provided further practice and reinforcement of programming principles and techniques.

- **HackerRank Solutions:** Solutions to various coding challenges from HackerRank, a platform for practicing coding skills and competing in coding competitions.

- **CodeWars Katas:** Solutions to CodeWars katas, which are small coding challenges that range from beginner to advanced difficulty levels. These katas helped improve my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

### TO-DO
---
- **Retry Katas:** I plan to revisit and tackle some of the CodeWars katas again. However, as I've been busy programming full time, this repository has been quite abandoned. Nevertheless, I aim to find time to continue honing my skills and exploring new challenges.
