# Code Challenges Repository

Welcome to my Code Challenges Repository ðŸ‘½

This repository serves as a **catch-all** for a wide variety of coding challenges and exercises completed mainly during my time at IronHack and KeepCoding web development bootcamps. 

Here, you'll find a diverse collection of projects ranging from basic algorithms to more complex data structures and algorithms challenges.

### Why This Repository?
<br>
<p>This repository serves as a consolidated archive of my coding journey, showcasing the progression of my skills and knowledge in web development and problem-solving. These katas helped improve my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking. </p> 

Whether you're a fellow developer looking for inspiration or a coding enthusiast eager to tackle new challenges, I hope you find something valuable here.

#### TO-DO
- [ ] Retry Katas: I plan to revisit and tackle some of the CodeWars katas again.
- [ ] Try New Katas: as I've been busy programming full time, this repository has been quite abandoned. Nevertheless, I aim to find time to continue honing my skills and exploring new challenges.
- [ ] Become a Programmer Ninja
